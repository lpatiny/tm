servoMovement3/3.mov presents the optimum movement of the mass we could possibly get with the servos on the outside method. In this case, the servo axis and the radius of the circle the mass follows equals half of the center-servo distance. It is interesting to notice that the servo does not have a constant speed. It is faster when alpha is getting smaller. It would be interesting to analyse the speeds evolution.
