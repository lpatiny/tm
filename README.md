## Concept

The goal of this project is to realise a remote controll ball that will roll by moving it's gravity center. Since it is a really complex project, we begin by developing a 2D cylinder that would work on the same concept. The approach chosen to make the mass move is to use three servos on the outside the cylinder, these would be connected to the mass with rigid bars.
