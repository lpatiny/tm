# Remote control ball
------
This repositroy will contain all the data that was used and produced to realise this project. Wich means:
*pictures
* a latex document
* schemes
* models

## Goal

The goal of this project is to realise a remote controll ball that will roll by moving it's gravity center. Since it is a really complex project, we begin by developing a 2D cylinder that would work on the same concept.
