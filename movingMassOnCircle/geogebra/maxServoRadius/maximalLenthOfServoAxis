We observed that the maximal legth of the axis of the servos is not necessarily a third of the cylinders radius. Indeed, we verified graphicaly that it can be up to a half, the trajectories of the servos are then meeting in the center, and the mass runs exactly over the servos rotation axes. This implies that there seems to be a problem on the 2D geogebra figure, but in 3D many plans might be used to make it possible. However, there is another problem with a servos axis equal to half of R, that concerns something that we already observed: the speed of the servo, when alpha is getting smaller, is getting bigger when the ratio servoAxis/R augments. And in the Half case, the speed needs to be infinite. The limitation of the servo axis length is then only the servos maximal angular speed.
