We observed that the maximal legth of the axis of the servos is not necessarily a third of the cylinders radius. Indeed, we verified graphicaly that it can be up to a half, the trajectories of the servos are then meeting in thecenter, and the mass runs exactly over the servos rotation axes. This implies that there seems to be a problem on the 2D geogebra figure, but in 3D many plans might be used to make it possible. However, there is another problem with a servos axis equal to half of R, that concerns something that we already observed: the speed of the servo, when aplpha is getting smaller, must be bigger when the ratio R/servoAxis is being bigger. And in the Half case, the speed needs to be infinite. The limitation of the servo axis length is then only how fast that one can vary of angle.
